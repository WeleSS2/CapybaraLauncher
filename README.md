Project abandoned from 2 reasons. 1 Qt Creator destroyed original repository (Thanks auto-update), 2nd i need to focus on more life-oriented project.


# Capybara Laucher

A simple application for Total War game series which allow to manage mods and create mods list, also content creators are able to add their news to launcher :) This is beta version and aren't everything added yet but i'll work over it.

If do you want to contribute please contact with me on discord. There is necessary a huge rework of code in this app and i think i'll be doing it slowly so contributing can be hard.
